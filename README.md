# Kwirk Escape

Simple web project by [Nicklas Hummelsheim](https://github.com/hummelsheim) and [Edward Suer](https://github.com/Eddix3) as part of our studies at TH LÃ¼beck.

The aim was to familiarize ourselves with web technologies by programming a small game.

The game chosen as a template and implemented was [Kwirk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwirk).

The final report on the project can be found [here](/doc/Kwirk%20Escape.pdf) (German).

## Attention

The project was originally hosted via Docker, but the `Dockerfile` and `.gitlab-ci.yaml` were omitted.
